In a tabular format: 

1. #Give 5 difference between HTML  div tag, section tag and article.  -->
Certainly, here's a tabular format outlining how `meta` tags, including `meta charset="UTF-8"`, work and their functions:

| Function                              | Meta Tag Example                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Specify Character Encoding            | `<meta charset="UTF-8">`                            | Informs the browser that the document is encoded using the UTF-8 character encoding standard. This ensures correct interpretation and display of text, symbols, and emojis.       |
| Provide Metadata                      | `<meta name="description" content="Description">`    | Provides metadata about the webpage, such as title, description, author, keywords, and character encoding. This metadata is used by browsers, search engines, and other services. |
| Enhance SEO                           | `<title>Your Title</title>`<br>`<meta name="description" content="Description">`<br>`<meta name="keywords" content="Keywords">` | Influences how search engines index and rank webpages by providing relevant titles, descriptions, and keywords.                                                               |
| Configure Viewport                    | `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` | Controls the layout and scaling of a webpage on different devices, ensuring optimal display and usability, especially on mobile devices.                                       |
| Customize Social Media Sharing        | Open Graph: `<meta property="og:title" content="Title">`<br>`<meta property="og:description" content="Description">`<br>`<meta property="og:image" content="Image URL">` | Customizes how content appears when shared on social media platforms by providing compelling titles, descriptions, and images.                                                  |
| Control Browser Behavior              | `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=https://example.com">`<br>`<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">` | Influences the behavior of web browsers, such as automatic redirection, compatibility mode settings, and other browser-specific behaviors.                                  |

These meta tags and their functions play essential roles in web development, ensuring proper display, accessibility, search engine visibility, and user experience of webpages.




         <!-- ## How does meta- UTF-8 work, Meta tags functions -->
      2.1. Meta-UTF-8 (<meta charset="UTF-8">):
      The charset attribute in the meta tag is used to specify the character encoding for an HTML document. When you set charset="UTF-8", it informs the browser that the document is encoded using the UTF-8 character encoding standard.
      
      Character Encoding: UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit) is a variable-width character encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. It's widely used on the web because it supports a broad range of characters from various languages and scripts.
      
      How it Works: When the browser encounters <meta charset="UTF-8">, it interprets the document's text content using UTF-8 encoding. This ensures that characters from different languages, special symbols, and emojis are displayed correctly on the webpage.
      
      Compatibility: UTF-8 is widely supported by modern browsers and is the default character encoding for HTML5 documents. It ensures consistency and interoperability across different platforms and devices.
      
      2. Meta Tags Functions:
      Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage. They serve various functions to improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), social media sharing, and overall user experience of a website. Here are some common functions of meta tags:
      
      Metadata: Meta tags provide information about the webpage, such as the title, description, author, keywords, and character encoding. This metadata is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services to understand and index the content of the webpage accurately.
      
      SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Meta tags play a crucial role in SEO by influencing how search engines index and rank webpages. Tags like <title>, <meta name="description">, and <meta name="keywords"> help search engines understand the relevance and context of the webpage's content.
      
      Viewport Configuration: The <meta name="viewport"> tag is used to control the layout and scaling of a webpage on different devices, especially mobile devices. It allows web developers to optimize the viewport settings for better readability and usability across various screen sizes and resolutions.
      
      Social Media Sharing: Meta tags like Open Graph (<meta property="og:title">, <meta property="og:description">, <meta property="og:image">) and Twitter Card (<meta name="twitter:title">, <meta name="twitter:description">, <meta name="twitter:image">) are used to customize how content appears when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. They ensure that shared links include compelling titles, descriptions, and images.
      
      Browser Behavior Control: Meta tags can influence the behavior of web browsers in various ways. For example, the <meta http-equiv="refresh"> tag can be used to automatically refresh or redirect a webpage after a specified time interval. Other http-equiv attributes like X-UA-Compatible can control the compatibility mode of the browser.
